        Erta Ale is 613 metres (2,011 ft) high, with one or sometimes two active
        lava lakes at the summit which occasionally overflow on the south side
        of the volcano.[1] It is notable for holding the longest-existing lava
        lake, present since the early years of the twentieth century (1906).
        Volcanoes with lava lakes are very rare: there are only eight in the
        world.[4] Erta Ale means "smoking mountain" in the local Afar language
        and its southernmost pit is known locally as "the gateway to Hell".
